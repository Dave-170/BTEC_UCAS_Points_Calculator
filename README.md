## Additional Information

This application was initially created during my time studying for a BTEC Diploma. I've updated it to align with the BTEC 2023 points system rather than the old one that I was scored on for fun but I also keep it around as a reminder that there is always more to learn and as a memory of the 1st useful program I made .

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the .NET SDK installed to build and run the application.
